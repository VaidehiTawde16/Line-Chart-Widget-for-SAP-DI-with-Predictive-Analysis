SAP Analytics Cloud Account: Ensure you have an active account on SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC). If you don't have an account, you can sign up for one on the SAP Analytics Cloud website.

## Steps to Set Up and Use the Custom Widgets

### Login to SAP Analytics Cloud:

Open your web browser and navigate to the SAP Analytics Cloud login page.

Enter your credentials to log in.

### Navigate to Stories:

Once logged in, navigate to the Stories section in SAP Analytics Cloud. 

You can find this option in the main menu on the left side of the dashboard.

### Add a Custom Widget:

Within the Stories section, look for the option to add a custom widget. This can typically be found under the “+” (Add) button or within the widget settings.

Choose the option to add a custom widget.

### Upload the JSON File:

When prompted, first upload the Linechart.json or Barchart.json file.

This JSON file contains the metadata and configuration for the custom widget.

### Upload the Zipped JS File:

After uploading the JSON file, you will be prompted to upload the JavaScript file for the widget.

Zip the Linechart.js or Barchart.js file before uploading it.

Upload the zipped JavaScript file to the custom widget setup.

### Create a Story:

After successfully uploading the JSON and JS files, a new story will be created in SAP Analytics Cloud.

You can now navigate to the file where the story is created.

### Add Data to the EChart:

Within the story, navigate to the custom widget you added.

Connect the widget to your data by configuring the data feeds in SAC. Select the appropriate dimensions and measures for the visualization.

Once the data is connected, the ECharts line or bar chart will render within the story.

### View and Interact with the Chart:

The chart will now be visible and interactive within your SAC story. You can further customize the data and appearance through the SAC interface.

### Save and Share:

Save the story with your newly added custom widget.

You can share the story with others or export it as needed.
